# Team-Profile-Generator

This is a Team Profile Generator. This uses Node and command line prompts to ask questions about the manager and team members.

This application uses classes for each of the objects: Managers, Engineers & Interns, all inheriting from the Employee base class.

This application uses Jest for Unit testing. With each class having its own test case.

Here is a screenshot of the generated output file:
